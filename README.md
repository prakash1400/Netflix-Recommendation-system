Netflix Movie Recommender System
Overview
This project implements a content-based movie recommendation system for Netflix, utilizing a dataset of over 17,000 movies and 500,000+ user ratings. By leveraging machine learning techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Cosine Similarity, this system recommends movies to users based on their preferences and past behavior. The primary focus is on extracting meaningful features from movie data and creating a robust recommendation algorithm.

Features
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on a user’s interaction with similar movies, using TF-IDF to represent text-based features and Cosine Similarity to compute recommendations.
Dataset: Includes information on movies such as titles, genres, cast, and ratings.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights into Netflix's movie and TV show trends, such as distribution of genres, popular directors, and movie release years.
Objectives
Analyze state-of-the-art recommendation systems for movie suggestions.
Build a content-based machine learning model using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity.
Evaluate the model’s effectiveness in recommending relevant movies.
Dataset
The dataset consists of over 17,000 movies and 500,000+ user ratings, covering various attributes such as:

Movie title
Year of release
Cast and crew
Viewer ratings
Tools and Technologies
Python: Used for data processing and model building.
Pandas: For data manipulation.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms like TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity.
Tableau: Used for visualization during Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/netflix-recommender.git
cd netflix-recommender
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the notebook: Open the Netflix Recommender System.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment to execute the code.

Usage
Recommendation: Input a movie title, and the system will provide a list of similar movies based on content features like genres, plot, and cast.
Customization: You can modify the dataset or tweak the similarity functions to adjust the recommendations.
Model
The recommendation system uses:

TF-IDF: To quantify the significance of movie features like descriptions.
Cosine Similarity: To measure how closely movies resemble each other based on their feature vectors.
Results
The system provides recommendations with reasonable accuracy, using the Cosine Similarity metric to suggest movies similar to the ones the user has already interacted with.

Future Work
Collaborative Filtering: Integrating user interaction data to enhance recommendations.
Feature Enhancement: Including more detailed attributes like language and director-specific preferences.
Machine Learning Integration: Adding more advanced techniques like dynamic weight adjustments through machine learning.
